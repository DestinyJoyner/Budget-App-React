#### (1) Navigation/Nav Bar

- The Nav bar allows me to navigate to the Index and New pages

#### (2) Index Page

- I can see a list of income and expenditures with the date, the transaction name and the amount on the Index page.

- There is also an Account total visible that sums all the different expenditures and shows the user how much money they currently have.

#### (3) New Page

- I can click on a "New" button that takes me to the New page, with a form that lets me create a new transaction.

- Once a transaction is created, I am navigated back to the Index page

#### (4) Show Page

- I can see a single expenditure with more details and appropriate navigation links

#### (5) Edit page 

- I can see a form that is pre-filled with an individual expenditure that allows me to update the expenditure. Once updated, I am taken back to the show page where I should be able to see the updated transaction, without needing to refresh the page.

- The edit form is accessible from the Show page.

#### (6) Delete functionality

- The expenditure can be deleted from the Show page

#### (7) Account Total
 
 - The account total is visible on the Index page and in the Nav Bar.
 - The account CSS changes depending on the amount. The account should show green (or similar color) if the amount is above $1000. There should be neutral/white color between $0 - $1000. And it should show a red (or similar color) if the bank account value falls below $0. 

#### (8) UX/UI

- Forms are styled and properly labeled. The navigation is clear and easy to use, a color theme has been chosen and applied. At least one font has been chosen and applied. The app is responsive (readable/usable) across multiple screen sizes/widths.

#### (9) Deployed online

- I can visit the application via the internet

#### (10) Pending Transactions (Bonus Feature)

- In order to test out the Pending Transactions functionality, as a user, you will have to add a transaction that is dated at some point in the future.
